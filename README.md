# Canvas Dashboard and AI Assistance

### About
In Canvas there are several ways to get out certain types of information. However, it can be a bit of annoyance to try and remember exact where everything is.
With this project, our team designed a web app for interfacing with your canvas data, grades, and courses to see exactly where you stand academically.

### Events
The events section of the dashboard shows the most recent annoucements from your class. You can use this to see what course work is coming up!

### Total GPA
The total GPA is calculated based on the average gpa of all your courses.

### Courses GPA
Each course is given a GPA based on all your submitted assignments.


## Canvas API Usage

this project heavily relied on the [Canvas API](https://usflearn.instructure.com/doc/api/live), which allowed us to aggregate personal user data from an access token.
